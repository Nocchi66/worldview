The Laguna de Aculeo is a two hours' drive from Santiago, Chile and was a long-time popular summer vacation spot for boating, swimming, and water skiing. A combination of nearby population growth, purchasing of water rights for agriculture, and drought caused the shallow lake to go dry in 2018. This true-color reflectance image of 18 May 2023 from HLS Landsat 8 satellite shows a dry lake bed in shades of brown in the center of the view.
